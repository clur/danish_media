python topicmodel2.py NI 3 10000

1st parameter can be NI, OV, DS  (nemid, overvågning, digital signatur)
2nd paramter is the number of topics you want to find
3rd parameter is the number of features to use,
    -for nemid and digital signatur a high number (200000) is fine as there are fewer articles, but for overvågning will crash with many features, better to stick to 10000
    -it is unclear how much different numbers of features affect the clusters, as this is unsupervised, it is hard to measure the advantage of more or less features

A folder will be made in the current directory called f.ex. NI_3_topics
inside this folder are two files, 3_topics_topwords and 3_topics.csv
and 3 subdirectories, one for each topic. The articles most related to each topic are written there.
